## Instructions on how to compile the code

1. In the command line, navigate to the src directory by running `cd <path to the src directory>`

2. Compile the ReadFile.java file by running `javac ReadFile.java` (or run with path to the ReadFile.java ignoring step1)

## Instructions on how to run the code

1. Inside the src directory, run the executable file `ReadFile.class` by running `java ReadFile <filename.in>`, 
  where <filename.in> is a path to the input file

## What works and what doesn't work

What works (Everything works):
  1. The executable file take a filename <filename.in> and create a new file <filename.out>
    in the same directory
  2. In the output file, the blank lines and leading white spaces are stripped
  3. All the comments are removed, both single lined and multi-lined.
